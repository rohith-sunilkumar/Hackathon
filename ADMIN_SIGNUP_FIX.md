# ✅ Admin Signup Redirect Issue - FIXED!

## 🐛 Problem

When an admin signed up, they were being automatically logged in and redirected to the admin dashboard, even though they needed mayor approval first.

## ✅ Solution

Fixed the registration flow so that:
1. **Admins are NOT auto-logged in** after registration
2. **Admins see a clear success message** telling them to wait for approval
3. **Form is hidden** after successful registration
4. **Clear next steps** are provided

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. AuthContext.jsx
**Fixed the `register` function to NOT auto-login admins:**

```javascript
const register = async (userData) => {
  const response = await authAPI.register(userData);
  const { user, token } = response.data.data;
  
  // Don't auto-login admins - they need mayor approval first
  if (user.role === 'admin') {
    return { 
      success: true, 
      user,
      needsApproval: true  // Flag to indicate approval needed
    };
  }
  
  // Auto-login citizens and mayors
  localStorage.setItem('token', token);
  localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(user));
  setUser(user);
  
  return { success: true, user };
};
```

### 2. Register.jsx
**Updated registration handling:**

```javascript
if (result.success) {
  if (result.needsApproval || formData.role === 'admin') {
    // Admin registered - show success message and DON'T navigate
    setSuccess('Admin account created! Pending mayor approval...');
    setLoading(false);
    // Reset form
    setFormData({ ...initialState });
  } else {
    // Citizen registered - auto-login and navigate
    navigate('/');
  }
}
```

**Enhanced success message with:**
- ✅ Clear approval status
- ✅ Next steps instructions
- ✅ Button to go to login page
- ✅ Button to register another admin
- ✅ Form hidden when success shown
