```

### **Database**:

## 🎯 How to Use

### **1. For Citizens**:

**Create Report**:
```bash
POST http://localhost:5000/api/department-reports
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>
Body: {
  "title": "Pothole on Main Street",
  "description": "Large pothole causing issues",
  "category": "Road Service Department"  # Optional
}
```

### **2. For Admins**:

**View Department Reports**:
```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/api/department-reports
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>

# Returns only reports from admin's department
```

**Get Statistics**:
```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/api/department-reports/stats
Headers: Authorization: Bearer <token>

# Returns stats for all departments
```

---

## 📊 Department Isolation

### **How It Works**:

1. **Report Created**:
   - Citizen submits report
   - AI classifies category
   - System determines department
   - Saves to department-specific collection

2. **Admin Views**:
   - Admin logs in
   - System checks admin's department
   - Queries only that department's collection
   - Returns only relevant reports

### **Example**:
```
Road Admin (road@demo.com):
  ✅ Can see: roadservicereports collection
  ❌ Cannot see: water, electrical, hospital, general collections

Water Admin (water@demo.com):
  ✅ Can see: watermanagementreports collection
  ❌ Cannot see: road, electrical, hospital, general collections
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### **Test 1: Create Road Report**:
```bash
# Login as citizen
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "citizen@demo.com",
  "password": "password"
}

# Create report
POST /api/department-reports
{
  "title": "Pothole on Main Street",
  "description": "Large pothole",
  "category": "Road Service Department"
}

# Check it went to road collection
npm run show-depts
# Should show 1 report in roadservicereports
```

### **Test 2: Admin Access**:
```bash
# Login as Road Admin
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "road@demo.com",
  "password": "password"
}

# Get reports
GET /api/department-reports
# Should return reports from roadservicereports only

# Login as Water Admin
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "water@demo.com",
  "password": "password"
}

# Get reports
GET /api/department-reports
# Should return empty (no water reports yet)
```
