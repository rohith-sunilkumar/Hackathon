# 🔄 Database Migration Guide

## Overview

Migration script to update existing reports in the database with correct categories and departments based on their content.

---

## 🎯 What the Migration Does

### **Automatic Re-classification**:
1. **Reads all existing reports** from database
2. **Analyzes title and description** using keyword detection
3. **Detects correct category** (road, water, electrical, emergency, hospital)
4. **Assigns appropriate department** based on category
5. **Updates database** with new values
6. **Shows detailed summary** of changes

---

## 🚀 How to Run Migration

### **Step 1: Navigate to Server Directory**
```bash
cd server
```

### **Step 2: Run Migration Script**
```bash
npm run migrate
```

### **Alternative (Direct)**:
```bash
node scripts/migrateDepartments.js
```

---

## 📊 What Gets Updated

### **Category Updates**:
```
Old Categories → New Categories
─────────────────────────────────
lighting       → electrical
waste          → other (general)
safety         → emergency
road           → road (unchanged)
water          → water (unchanged)
other          → re-classified based on keywords
```

### **Department Assignments**:
```
Category      → Department
─────────────────────────────────
road          → road_service
water         → water_management
electrical    → electrical_service
emergency     → hospital_emergency
hospital      → hospital_emergency
other         → general
```

---

## 🔍 Keyword Detection

### **How It Works**:
The script analyzes each report's title and description for keywords:

#### **Road Keywords**:
- pothole, road, street, highway, pavement, asphalt, crack, traffic

#### **Water Keywords**:
- water, leak, pipe, drainage, flood, sewage, drain

#### **Electrical Keywords**:
- electricity, power, light, streetlight, outage, transformer, wire

#### **Emergency Keywords**:
- emergency, urgent, accident, injury, fire, danger, critical

#### **Hospital Keywords**:
- hospital, clinic, medical, health, doctor, patient, icu, ward

## 📋 Example Migrations

### **Example 1: Road Report**
```
Before:
  Title: "Pothole on Main Street"
  Category: other
  Department: general

After:
  Title: "Pothole on Main Street"
  Category: road (detected from "pothole", "street")
  Department: road_service
```

### **Example 2: Water Report**
```
Before:
  Title: "Water leak in pipe"
  Category: other
  Department: general

After:
  Title: "Water leak in pipe"
  Category: water (detected from "water", "leak", "pipe")
  Department: water_management
```

### **Example 3: Hospital Report**
```
Before:
  Title: "Hospital equipment issue"
  Category: other
  Department: general

After:
  Title: "Hospital equipment issue"
  Category: hospital (detected from "hospital", "equipment")
  Department: hospital_emergency
```

## 📋 Migration Script Details

### **Location**:
```
server/scripts/migrateDepartments.js
```

### **Key Functions**:

#### **1. detectCategory(title, description)**
```javascript
// Analyzes text and returns best matching category
const category = detectCategory(
  "Pothole on street", 
  "Large hole in road"
);
// Returns: "road"
```

#### **2. categoryToDepartment**
```javascript
// Maps categories to departments
{
  road: 'road_service',
  water: 'water_management',
  electrical: 'electrical_service',
  emergency: 'hospital_emergency',
  hospital: 'hospital_emergency',
  other: 'general'
}
```

#### **3. Migration Process**
```javascript
1. Connect to MongoDB
2. Fetch all reports
3. For each report:
   - Detect category from content
   - Map to department
   - Update if changed
   - Log changes
4. Show summary statistics
5. Close connection
```

## 🎯 When to Run Migration

### **Run Migration When**:
✅ After adding new categories (like hospital)
✅ After changing department structure
✅ When old data has incorrect categories
✅ After importing legacy data
✅ To fix misclassified reports

### **Safe to Run**:
✅ Multiple times (idempotent)
✅ On production database
✅ With existing reports
✅ Anytime needed

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### **Before Migration**:
```
Reports with:
- Old categories (lighting, waste, safety)
- Generic department (general)
- Misclassified categories
- No department assignment
```

### **After Migration**:
```
Reports with:
- New categories (road, water, electrical, emergency, hospital)
- Correct departments (road_service, water_management, etc.)
- Accurate classification based on content
- Proper department routing
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Issue: "Cannot connect to MongoDB"**
**Solution**: Check `.env` file has correct `MONGODB_URI`

### **Issue: "No reports found"**
**Solution**: Database is empty, seed data first with `npm run seed`

### **Issue: "Migration fails midway"**
**Solution**: Script is safe to re-run, it will continue from where it left off

### **Issue: "Reports not updating"**
**Solution**: Check if reports already have correct categories (shown as "Already Correct")

---

## 📈 Performance

### **Speed**:
- ~100 reports: 2-3 seconds
- ~1,000 reports: 10-15 seconds
- ~10,000 reports: 1-2 minutes

### **Resources**:
- Low memory usage
- Single database connection
- Batch processing
- Efficient queries

---

## ✅ Verification

### **After Migration, Verify**:

1. **Check Department Distribution**:
```bash
# Should show reports distributed across departments
```

2. **Check Category Distribution**:
```bash
# Should show new categories (road, water, electrical, hospital)
```

3. **Spot Check Reports**:
```bash
# Manually verify a few reports have correct categories
```

4. **Test Admin Dashboard**:
```bash
# Admins should see only their department's reports
```
