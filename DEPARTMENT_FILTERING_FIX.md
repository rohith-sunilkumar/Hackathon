# 🔧 Department Filtering Fix

## Problem

Road Department admin was seeing reports with category "Other" because the `assignedDepartment` field wasn't being set correctly when users manually selected a department.

---

## 🐛 Root Cause

### **Issue**:
When a user manually selected a department in the report form:
1. The `category` field was being set (e.g., "General Department")
2. But the `assignedDepartment` field was still being set by AI
3. This caused mismatch between category and assigned department

### **Example of Bug**:
```
User selects: "General Department"
     ↓
Backend receives: category = "General Department"
     ↓
AI runs anyway: assignedDepartment = "road_service" (wrong!)
     ↓
Report saved with:
  - category: "General Department"
  - assignedDepartment: "road_service"
     ↓
Result: Road admin sees "General Department" report ❌
```

---

## ✅ Solution

Added logic to properly handle user-selected categories and map them to the correct department.

### **Fixed Flow**:
```
User selects: "General Department"
     ↓
Backend receives: category = "General Department"
     ↓
Check: User selected a category? Yes
     ↓
Map to department: "general"
     ↓
Skip AI classification
     ↓
Report saved with:
  - category: "General Department"
  - assignedDepartment: "general"
     ↓
Result: General admin sees report ✅
```

---

## 🔧 Implementation

### **Category to Department Mapping**:
```javascript
const categoryToDepartment = {
  'Road Service Department': 'road_service',
  'Hospital Emergency Department': 'hospital_emergency',
  'Water Management Department': 'water_management',
  'Electrical Service Department': 'electrical_service',
  'General Department': 'general'
};
```

### **Logic Flow**:
```javascript
if (userSelectedCategory && categoryToDepartment[userSelectedCategory]) {
  // User manually selected department
  finalCategory = userSelectedCategory;
  finalDepartment = categoryToDepartment[userSelectedCategory];
  finalPriority = 'medium';
} else {
  // Use AI Classification
  aiResult = await classifyComplaint(title, description, imagePaths);
  finalCategory = aiResult.category;
  finalPriority = aiResult.priority;
  finalDepartment = aiResult.department;
}

// Create report with correct values
await Report.create({
  category: finalCategory,
  priority: finalPriority,
  assignedDepartment: finalDepartment,
  ...
});
```

## 📊 Before vs After

### **Before (Broken)**:
```
User Input:
  - Title: "See That Issue"
  - Category: "General Department" (manually selected)

Backend Processing:
  - Receives category: "General Department"
  - Runs AI anyway
  - AI assigns: assignedDepartment = "road_service"

Database:
  - category: "General Department"
  - assignedDepartment: "road_service" ❌ MISMATCH

Result:
  - Road admin sees "General Department" report ❌
  - General admin doesn't see the report ❌
```

### **After (Fixed)**:
```
User Input:
  - Title: "See That Issue"
  - Category: "General Department" (manually selected)

Backend Processing:
  - Receives category: "General Department"
  - Maps to: assignedDepartment = "general"
  - Skips AI classification

Database:
  - category: "General Department"
  - assignedDepartment: "general" ✅ CORRECT

Result:
  - General admin sees the report ✅
  - Road admin doesn't see it ✅
```

## 🎯 Key Changes

### **1. Extract User-Selected Category**:
```javascript
const { title, description, location, category: userSelectedCategory } = req.body;
```

### **2. Check if User Selected**:
```javascript
if (userSelectedCategory && categoryToDepartment[userSelectedCategory]) {
  // Use user selection
} else {
  // Use AI
}
```

### **3. Map to Department**:
```javascript
finalDepartment = categoryToDepartment[userSelectedCategory];
```

### **4. Use Correct Values**:
```javascript
await Report.create({
  category: finalCategory,
  assignedDepartment: finalDepartment,
  ...
});
```

## 📋 Test Cases

### **Test 1: User Selects Road Department**
```
Input:
  - Title: "Pothole"
  - Category: "Road Service Department"

Expected:
  - category: "Road Service Department"
  - assignedDepartment: "road_service"
  - Visible to: Road admin ✅
```

### **Test 2: User Selects General Department**
```
Input:
  - Title: "See That Issue"
  - Category: "General Department"

Expected:
  - category: "General Department"
  - assignedDepartment: "general"
  - Visible to: General admin ✅
  - NOT visible to: Road admin ✅
```

### **Test 3: User Lets AI Decide**
```
Input:
  - Title: "Pothole on street"
  - Category: "" (empty - let AI decide)

Expected:
  - AI analyzes: "pothole", "street"
  - category: "Road Service Department"
  - assignedDepartment: "road_service"
  - Visible to: Road admin ✅
```

---

## 🔍 Debugging

### **Check Report in Database**:
```javascript
{
  title: "See That Issue",
  category: "General Department",
  assignedDepartment: "general", // Should match category
  reporter: "user_id"
}
```

### **Verify Admin Can See**:
```javascript
// General admin query
query.assignedDepartment = 'general'

// Should return the report ✅
```

### **Verify Other Admins Cannot See**:
```javascript
// Road admin query
query.assignedDepartment = 'road_service'

// Should NOT return the report ✅
```

---

## ✅ Summary

### **Fixed**:
✅ User-selected category now maps to correct department
✅ `assignedDepartment` matches `category`
✅ Reports go to correct admin
✅ No cross-department visibility

### **How It Works**:
1. **User selects department** → Maps to correct `assignedDepartment`
2. **User lets AI decide** → AI assigns both category and department
3. **Both paths** → Correct department assignment

### **Result**:
🎯 **Reports go to correct department**
🔒 **No cross-department leakage**
✅ **Road admin only sees road reports**
✅ **General admin only sees general reports**

---

**Status**: ✅ Fixed
**File**: server/routes/reports.js
**Issue**: Category-Department mismatch

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the fix**:
   - Create report with "General Department"
   - Login as General admin → Should see it ✅
   - Login as Road admin → Should NOT see it ✅

2. **Verify existing reports**:
   - Check database for mismatched reports
   - Run migration if needed to fix old data

**The department filtering now works correctly!** 🎯✨
