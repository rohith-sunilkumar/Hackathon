# ✅ Private Feedback System - Already Implemented!

## 🔐 Feedback Privacy is ALREADY WORKING!

The feedback system is **already private** - only one-to-one connection between the user and their specific department admin.

---

## 🎯 How Privacy Works

### Who Can See Feedback?

**For a Report's Feedback:**
- ✅ **The User** who created the report
- ✅ **The Admin** of the department assigned to that report
- ❌ **NO other departments** can see it
- ❌ **NO other users** can see it

### Example Scenario

```
User creates report → Assigned to Road Department
User sends feedback: "When will this be fixed?"
Road Admin responds: "We'll fix it tomorrow"

✅ User can see: Their message + Road Admin's response
✅ Road Admin can see: User's message + Their response
❌ Water Admin CANNOT see this feedback
❌ Electrical Admin CANNOT see this feedback
❌ Other users CANNOT see this feedback
```

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Privacy Checks

The system verifies access on **EVERY request**:

```javascript
// Check authorization before showing feedback
const isReporter = report.reporter.toString() === req.user._id.toString();

// Extract department from report
const reportDepartment = report.assignedDepartment;

// Check if admin belongs to same department
const isAuthorizedAdmin = req.user.role === 'admin' && 
                          reportDepartment === req.user.department;

// Only allow access if user is reporter OR authorized admin
if (!isReporter && !isAuthorizedAdmin) {
  return res.status(403).json({
    message: 'Not authorized to view feedback for this report'
  });
}
```

### Privacy Enforcement

**GET Feedback:**
```javascript
GET /api/feedback/:reportId

Privacy Check:
1. Find the report
2. Check if user is the reporter
3. OR check if user is admin of report's department
4. If NO to both → 403 Forbidden
5. If YES → Show feedback
```

**POST Feedback:**
```javascript
POST /api/feedback/:reportId

Privacy Check:
1. Find the report
2. Check if user is the reporter
3. OR check if user is admin of report's department
4. If NO to both → 403 Forbidden
5. If YES → Allow sending feedback
```
