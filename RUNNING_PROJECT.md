## 🔐 Department Isolation

### **How It Works**:

**Road Admin (road@demo.com)**:
```
Logs in → Frontend calls /api/department-reports
       ↓
Backend checks: user.department = "road_service"
       ↓
Queries: roadservicereports collection
       ↓
Returns: ONLY road reports ✅
```

**Water Admin (water@demo.com)**:
```
Logs in → Frontend calls /api/department-reports
       ↓
Backend checks: user.department = "water_management"
       ↓
Queries: watermanagementreports collection
       ↓
Returns: ONLY water reports ✅
```

**Result**: Complete isolation! ✅
