## 🎯 Scoring Algorithm

### **Keyword Matching**:
```javascript
For each keyword found in title/description:
  - Base score: +1 point
  - Priority keyword match: +2 bonus points
  
Final category = highest score
Confidence = min(0.95, 0.6 + (score * 0.1))
```

### **Example**:
```
Input: "Large pothole on Main Street causing traffic issues"

Keyword Matches:
- "pothole" → road +1
- "large pothole" → road +2 (priority)
- "street" → road +1
- "traffic" → road +1

Total Score: 5 points
Category: road
Confidence: min(0.95, 0.6 + (5 * 0.1)) = 0.95 ✅
```

---

## 🔄 Multi-Source Validation

### **Agreement Checking**:

#### **Scenario 1: All Three Agree** ✅✅✅
```
Rule-Based: road (5 matches)
Image Analysis: road (0.95 confidence)
AI Classification: road (0.90 confidence)

Result:
- Category: road
- Confidence: 0.99 (maximum)
- Agreement: 100%
```

#### **Scenario 2: Two Agree** ✅✅
```
Rule-Based: road (3 matches)
Image Analysis: road (0.92 confidence)
AI Classification: water (0.80 confidence)

Result:
- Category: road (rule-based override)
- Confidence: 0.92
- Agreement: 66%
```

#### **Scenario 3: AI Only** ✅
```
Rule-Based: other (0 matches)
Image Analysis: none
AI Classification: road (0.85 confidence)

Result:
- Category: road
- Confidence: 0.85
- Agreement: AI decision
```

---

## 🛡️ Safety Mechanisms

### **Rule-Based Override**:
```javascript
if (ruleBasedMatches >= 3 && ruleBasedCategory !== aiCategory) {
  // Use rule-based result
  finalCategory = ruleBasedCategory
  confidence = max(aiConfidence, ruleBasedConfidence)
}
```

**Why?**: If we find 3+ strong keyword matches (e.g., "pothole", "road", "street"), we trust the rule-based system even if AI disagrees.

### **Confidence Boosting**:
```javascript
// Base confidence from AI
finalConfidence = 0.80

// +5% if rule-based agrees
if (ruleBasedCategory === aiCategory) {
  finalConfidence += 0.05
}

// +10% if images agree
if (imageCategory === aiCategory) {
  finalConfidence += 0.10
}

// +5% if all three agree
if (allThreeAgree) {
  finalConfidence += 0.05
}

// Result: 0.80 + 0.05 + 0.10 + 0.05 = 1.00 (capped at 0.99)
```

## 🔍 Example: Road Issue Classification

### **Input**:
```
Title: "Large pothole on Main Street"
Description: "Dangerous hole in road causing traffic problems"
Image: Photo of pothole
```

### **Processing**:

#### **Step 1: Rule-Based (Instant)**
```
Keywords Found:
- "pothole" → road +1
- "large pothole" → road +2 (priority: high)
- "street" → road +1
- "road" → road +1
- "traffic" → road +1

Score: 6 points
Category: road
Priority: high
Confidence: 0.95
```

#### **Step 2: Image Analysis (~5 seconds)**
```
GPT-4 Vision detects:
- Issue Type: road
- Details: "Large pothole 2ft wide, 6in deep"
- Severity: high
- Hazards: ["Vehicle damage", "Trip hazard"]
- Confidence: 0.95
```

#### **Step 3: AI Classification (~3 seconds)**
```
GPT-4 Turbo analyzes:
- Text: "Large pothole on Main Street..."
- Rule-based: road (6 matches)
- Image: road (0.95 confidence)

Decision:
- Category: road
- Priority: high
- Confidence: 0.90
```

#### **Step 4: Multi-Source Validation**
```
Agreement Check:
✅ Rule-based: road (6 matches)
✅ Image: road (0.95 confidence)
✅ AI: road (0.90 confidence)

All three agree!

Final Confidence:
0.90 + 0.05 (rule-based) + 0.10 (image) + 0.05 (all agree)
= 1.10 → capped at 0.99
```

### **Final Result**:
```json
{
  "category": "road",
  "priority": "high",
  "department": "road_service",
  "confidence": 0.99,
  "reasoning": "Visual evidence shows significant road damage",
  "ruleBasedMatch": {
    "category": "road",
    "matches": 6,
    "agreed": true
  },
  "imageAnalysis": {
    "detected": "road",
    "details": "Large pothole 2ft wide, 6in deep",
    "hazards": ["Vehicle damage", "Trip hazard"],
    "visualConfidence": 0.95,
    "agreed": true
  }
}
```

**Result**: ✅ **99% confidence - Perfect classification!**
