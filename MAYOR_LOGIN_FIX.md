# ✅ Mayor Login Fixed - Only Mayor Credentials Work!

## 🐛 Problem Fixed

The mayor login page was allowing non-mayor users to login and redirect to wrong pages. Now it's fixed to **only accept mayor credentials**.

---

## ✅ What's Fixed

### 1. Login Validation ✅
- Only users with `role: 'mayor'` can access
- Non-mayor users are immediately logged out
- Clear error message shown

### 2. Redirect Protection ✅
- Non-mayor users cannot access mayor dashboard
- Automatic logout if wrong role detected
- Stays on login page with error

### 3. Session Check ✅
- Checks user role on page load
- Logs out non-mayor users automatically
- Only mayor stays logged in

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Frontend Fix (MayorLogin.jsx)

**Login Handler:**
```javascript
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  const result = await login(formData.email, formData.password);
  
  if (result.success) {
    if (result.user.role === 'mayor') {
      // ✅ Mayor - allow access
      navigate('/mayor/dashboard');
    } else {
      // ❌ Not mayor - logout and show error
      logout();
      setError('Access denied. Only mayor credentials are allowed.');
    }
  } else {
    setError('Invalid email or password');
  }
};
```

**Session Check:**
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (isAuthenticated) {
    if (user?.role === 'mayor') {
      // ✅ Mayor - redirect to dashboard
      navigate('/mayor/dashboard');
    } else {
      // ❌ Not mayor - logout
      logout();
    }
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, user]);
```
