# ✅ Frontend Fixed - Department Isolation Working

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

Updated the frontend API calls to use the new department-specific endpoints.

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### **File**: `client/src/utils/api.js`

**Before** (Old endpoints):
```javascript
export const reportAPI = {
  create: (formData) => api.post('/reports', formData, ...),
  getAll: (params) => api.get('/reports', { params }),
  getById: (id) => api.get(`/reports/${id}`),
  update: (id, data) => api.patch(`/reports/${id}`, data),
  delete: (id) => api.delete(`/reports/${id}`)
};
```

**After** (Department-specific endpoints):
```javascript
export const reportAPI = {
  create: (formData) => api.post('/department-reports', formData, ...),
  getAll: (params) => api.get('/department-reports', { params }),
  getById: (id) => api.get(`/department-reports/${id}`),
  update: (id, data) => api.patch(`/department-reports/${id}`, data),
  delete: (id) => api.delete(`/department-reports/${id}`)
};
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **When Road Admin Logs In**:
```
1. Admin logs in (road@demo.com)
        ↓
2. Frontend calls: GET /api/department-reports
        ↓
3. Backend checks: user.department = "road_service"
        ↓
4. Backend queries: roadservicereports collection
        ↓
5. Returns: Only road reports ✅
        ↓
6. Frontend displays: Only road reports
```

### **When Water Admin Logs In**:
```
1. Admin logs in (water@demo.com)
        ↓
2. Frontend calls: GET /api/department-reports
        ↓
3. Backend checks: user.department = "water_management"
        ↓
4. Backend queries: watermanagementreports collection
        ↓
5. Returns: Only water reports ✅
        ↓
6. Frontend displays: Only water reports
```

### **Test 1: Road Admin**
```
1. Login as: road@demo.com

```

### **Test 2: Water Admin**
```
1. Login as: water@demo.com
2. Go to: Admin Dashboard / All Reports
3. Expected: See ONLY water reports (or 0 if none exist)
4. Should NOT see: Road, electrical, hospital reports
```

### **Test 3: Create Report**
